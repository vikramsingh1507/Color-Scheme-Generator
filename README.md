# Color Scheme Generator App

### Deployed on Netlify: [Color Scheme Generator App](https://papaya-fenglisu-65c4fd.netlify.app/)

## Overview
The **Color Scheme Generator** is a simple and efficient tool that helps users create color schemes based on their color selection and mode preference. It provides the corresponding hex codes for the generated colors. The app makes use of a color API to fetch the scheme and implements modern JavaScript features like `fetch` and `promises` for API handling.

## Tech Stack
- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- **JavaScript**
- **Color API**

## Key Features
- **Color Selection:** Users can pick a base color using a color picker.
- **Mode Selection:** Users can choose different color scheme modes (e.g., monochromatic, analogous, complementary) from a dropdown selection bar.
- **Color Scheme Generation:** Upon selecting a color and mode, and clicking the 'Generate' button, the app generates a color scheme with corresponding hex codes.
- **Dynamic Updates:** The app dynamically displays the generated color scheme along with their hex values.
- **Responsive Design:** The layout is styled with CSS to ensure a smooth user experience across devices.

## API & JavaScript Features
- **Color API:** Used to fetch the color schemes based on the selected base color and mode.
- **Fetch API:** Handles asynchronous requests to the color API.
- **Promises:** JavaScript promises are used for handling the API response in a clean and efficient manner.

## How It Works
1. **Select a Color:** Use the color picker to choose your desired base color.
2. **Choose a Mode:** From the mode selection dropdown, select how you want the color scheme to be generated (e.g., shades, monochromatic).
3. **Generate the Scheme:** Click the "Generate" button, and the app will display the color scheme with corresponding hex codes.
